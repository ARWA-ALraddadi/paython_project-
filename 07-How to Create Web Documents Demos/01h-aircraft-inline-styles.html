	Ever since the dawn of heavier-than-air flight, inventors have tried to design new kinds of aircraft in order to <span style="color:red">achieve improved performance, introduce new capabilities, or just do something different</span>.  In this series we describe some of the stranger aircraft that have actually flown.</p>

	This month's featured aircraft: The Cole&#769;opte&#768;re
    </h2>

    <!-- Another styled paragraph -->
    <p style="text-align:justify">
	This month we celebrate France's <strong>SNECMA Cole&#769;opte&#768;re</strong>, another "tail sitter" from the 1950s.  The remarkable thing about this prototype Vertical Take Off and Landing aircraft was that it had a single <em>annular wing</em> that encircled the engine.  As with most VTOL aircraft the transition from vertical to horizontal flight proved highly challenging and the Cole&#769;opte&#768;re was destroyed during testing when it crashed attempting such a manoeuvre!  (The pilot ejected safely.)</p>
