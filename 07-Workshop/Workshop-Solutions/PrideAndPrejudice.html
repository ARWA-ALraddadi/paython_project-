    <h3 align="center">Chapter 1</h3>

      <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</p>

      <p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>

      <p><span style="color:green">"My dear Mr. Bennet,"</span> said his lady to him one day, <span style="color:green">"have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"</span></p>

      <p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>

      <p><span style="color:green">"But it is,"</span> returned she; <span style="color:green">"for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."</span></p>

      <p>Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>

      <p><span style="color:green">"Do you not want to know who has taken it?"</span> cried his wife impatiently.</p>

      <p><span style="color:brown">"<em>You</em> want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."</span></p>

      <p>This was invitation enough.</p>

      <p><span style="color:green">"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."</span></p>

      <p><span style="color:brown">"What is his name?"</span></p>

      <p><span style="color:green">"Bingley."</span></p>

      <p><span style="color:brown">"Is he married or single?"</span></p>

      <p><span style="color:green">"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"</span></p>

      <p><span style="color:brown">"How so? How can it affect them?"</span></p>

      <p><span style="color:green">"My dear Mr. Bennet,"</span> replied his wife, <span style="color:green">"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."</span></p>
