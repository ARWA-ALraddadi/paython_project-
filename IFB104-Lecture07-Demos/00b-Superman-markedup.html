    Yes, it's <strong>Superman</strong>, strange visitor from another planet who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men.  <strong>Superman</strong>, who can change the course of mighty rivers, bend steel in his bare hands, and who&mdash;disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great Metropolitan newspaper&mdash;fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American way.
