Ever since the dawn of heavier-than-air flight, inventors have tried to design new kinds of aircraft in order to achieve improved performance, introduce new capabilities, or just do something different.  In this series we describe some of the stranger aircraft that have actually flown.

This month's featured aircraft: The XFV Salmon

This month we celebrate the Lockheed XFV Salmon "tail sitter" from the 1950s.  This was one of a number of attempts to create a military aicraft that could take off and land vertically, without the need for a runway.  These "vertical risers" needed extremely powerful engines to pull themselves into the air from a standing start.  However, the real problem that caused such aircraft to be abandoned was the difficulty pilots faced trying to land while looking over their shoulders!
